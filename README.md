ðŸ“Š Technical Case Summary

This repository contains my solution to a technical case focused on data preparation, transformation, and analysis.

Tools and Technologies used:

Python (pandas, matplotlib)

Google Colab

SQL (via SQLAlchemy for query testing)

Excel (for initial data cleaning and formatting)

Main Steps:

Standardized raw CSV data: converted integer-formatted dates (e.g., 20231212) into proper datetime formats.

Performed data transformations to group and consolidate monthly values.

Created derived features to simplify time-based analysis.

Visualized data insights using matplotlib.

The project simulates a real-world scenario of ingesting and preparing raw sales data for further modeling or reporting in a Data Lakehouse-like structure.
